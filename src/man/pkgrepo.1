.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgrepo\fR provides the ability to create and manage \fBpkg\fR(5) package repositories. Package repositories are a predefined set of directories and files that permit the storage and retrieval of package data by \fBpkg\fR(1) and publication clients such as \fBpkgsend\fR(1) or \fBpkgrecv\fR(1). In addition, when network-based access to a package repository is needed, \fBpkg.depotd\fR(1m) can provide clients access to the repository to store and/or retrieve package data.

For a list of possible properties and the purpose and value of each property, see the \fBset\fR subcommand below.
.sp
With \fB-F\fR, specify an alternative output format. Supported formats are: \fBtsv\fR (Tab Separated Values), \fBjson\fR (JavaScript Object Notation as a single line), and \fBjson-formatted\fR (same as the previous, formatted for readability).

List the packages matching the specified patterns in the repository. If no patterns are specified, all packages will be listed. To list the latest version of a package, use \fBlatest\fR for the pattern version (e.g. \fBvim@latest\fR).
.sp
In the default output, the first column contains the name of the publisher of the package. The second column contains the name of the package. The third column is a flag showing the status of the package, where \fBo\fR indicates it is obsolete, and an \fBr\fR shows that it has been renamed (a form of obsoletion). The last column contains the release and branch versions of the package (see \fBpkg\fR(5)).
